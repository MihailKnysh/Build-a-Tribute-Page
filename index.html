      <h1>Mahatma Gandhi</h1>
      <p>
        Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial
        nationalist, and political ethicist, who employed nonviolent resistance
        to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British
        Rule, and in turn inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across
        the world.

                Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi is born in Porbandar, India.
              
              <p>
                Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi is born in Porbandar on the northwest
                coast of India. His parents are not educated but are well off
                compared to others in their village, which allows them to
                provide a good education for their son.

                Gandhi marries Kasturbai Makhanji in an arranged marriage.
              
              <p>
                At the age of 13, Gandhi marries 14 year-old Kasturbai Makhanji.
                Following the customs of their region, the children are part of
                an arranged marriage. They will have four children together.

                Gandhi goes to London to enter law school.
              
              <p>
                Gandhi begins studies at University College London. He studies
                Indian law and also joins the Vegetarian Society while there.
                Gandhi avoids eating meat or drinking alcohol throughout his
                life.

                Gandhi returns to India to start his career as a lawyer.
              
              <p>
                After completing his studies, Gandhi returns to India to start a
                law practice in Bombay. However, too shy to speak up in court,
                Gandhi's attempts to be a lawyer fail and he accepts various
                other jobs in legal firms.

                Gandhi goes to South Africa to work for a Muslim Indian law
                firm.
              
              <p>
                Gandhi agrees to travel to South Africa to help a Muslim Indian
                law firm with a lawsuit. He is shocked by the racial
                discrimination he finds there when he learns he is not allowed
                to travel in the first class section of the train. The trip
                becomes a major turning point for him as he devotes his life to
                the pursuit of equality and justice.

                Gandhi decides to stay in South Africa.
              
              <p>
                The day he is due to return to India, Gandhi learns about a bill
                that would deny Indians the right to vote. With no opposition to
                it, Gandhi's friends convince him to stay for another month to
                fight the bill. Gandhi ends up staying in South Africa for 20
                years.

                Gandhi publishes "The Green Pamphlet.
              
              <p>
                Gandhi writes a pamphlet about the discrimination Indians face
                in South Africa. Great Britain, which controls South Africa,
                believes that "The Green Pamphlet" is an anti-government
                document and begins to view Gandhi as a troublemaker.

                Gandhi is refused entry into South Africa.
              
              <p>
                Realizing that he is going to be staying in South Africa, Gandhi
                returns to Bombay to get his wife and children so he can bring
                them to South Africa. When their ship arrives at Port Natal in
                South Africa, a mob of angry white men, angry that he is
                stirring up trouble among the Indians, refuse to let Gandhi's
                family into the country. A local police superintendent helps
                Gandhi and his family leave the ship safely and he refuses to
                press charges on the mob.

                Gandhi asks the Indian community of South African to refuse to
                comply with the Transvaal Asiatic Registration Act.
              
              <p>
                When the Transvaal government announces that all Indians must
                register and produce identification on demand or risk
                deportation, Gandhi asks Indians to peacefully resist. The
                Indians agree, setting off seven years of protest and struggle
                between the Indians and government.

                Gandhi is arrested for the first time.
              
              <p>
                Among the first to see the court magistrate for his refusal to
                register with the government in South Africa, Gandhi is arrested
                and spends all of his time in prison reading. When he is
                arrested later that year, he reads "Civil Disobedience" by Henry
                David Thoreau and is even more committed to peaceful resistance.

                Gandhi is given the title Mahatma.
              
              <p>
                Rabindranath Tagore, and Indian poet and Nobel Laureate, refers
                to Gandhi for the first time as Mahatma. The title means "Great
                Soul" and is given by Hindus to only the holiest men. Gandhi is
                not fond of it because he believes all souls are equal.

                Gandhi publishes the Declaration of Independence of India.
              
              <p>
                Having returned to India as a hero in 1915, Gandhi leads the
                movement to break away from Great Britain. He publishes the
                Declaration of Independence of India, representing the Indian
                National Congress, and makes his case for Indian independence.

                Gandhi leads the Salt March in India.
              
              <p>
                Forced to buy salt only from Britain, Gandhi protests the
                monopoly by leading the Salt March from Sabermanti to the
                Arabian Sea, 240 miles away. Gandhi led tens of thousands of
                people by the time they reached the sea, where they defied the
                law by making their own salt. Protests break out all across
                India and 60,000 are arrested, including Gandhi.

                Great Britain grants India and Pakistan their independence.
              
              <p>
                Calling it the "noblest act of the British nation," Gandhi
                celebrates India's independence from England. Unfortunately, the
                celebration does not last when hundreds of thousands of people
                die as the result of violence between the Muslims of Pakistan
                and the Hindus of India.

                Gandhi is assassinated in New Delhi.
              
              <p>
                Gandhi is approached by Nathuram Vinayuk Godse, a Hindu
                nationalist. Gandhi blesses him and the man then shoots and
                kills him for being too sympathetic to the Muslims. Godse is
                wrong in his belief that killing Gandhi will lead to war that
                will eliminate Muslims. Instead, mourning over Gandhi's death
                leads to peace.
